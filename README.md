This will be a game similar to playing regular cards (the highest card in the draft wins the round), and playing for score. However, the difference between a classic game and this one would be that this is not a gambling game, and that it tends to be an entertainment game rather than one that promotes gambling.

To further decrease its "gambling game" image and make the app seem more like an entertainment game - the playing cards will be represented by beautiful gemstones and crystals. Such were given score and representation based on their "price per carat" in real life. So the higher the price per carat in real life of the gemstone or crystal that you got at hand - the higher the value of your card.
